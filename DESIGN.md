Fail if:

-  directory exists but it's not a working directory
-  is a working directory but has different config

-  but add an option to pass a custom working dir


Simple version first:

- fail and ask the user to cleanup manually.

- update the documentation to cover the cleanup


In the future:

- an option to remove the working dir on success/failure ????
